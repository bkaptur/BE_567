# BE_567

These files were used in my course project for BE 567 at UPenn as part of an introduction to modeling biological systems.

All simulations were based on a theoretical molecular understanding of the Ping-Ping pathway in Drosophila as a preliminary analysis to predict some of the dynamics and implications of a system that behaves similar to Ping-Pong.

4 models, A-D, were created with varying parameters and assumptions to assess implications of differing dynamics.
